# Parze

A parser combinator library re-written for dart.

This is a rewrite of my original go project [parze](https://github.com/SagarBhattacharya/parze)

This version is intended to be expanded over the original project. The semantics and API style might change over time from the original project. Anyone coming here for parze-go might want to gloss over the documentation ( when it is complete ofcourse ... hehe )
